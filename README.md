# AI Engineering Kit

> A spec-driven workflow for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code): turn an idea into a production-ready web app, one feature at a time — Requirements → Architecture → Tasks → Build → QA → Deploy.

This project was created with `npx create-ai-eng-app`. It ships a complete Next.js stack plus a set of Claude Code **Skills**, **Rules**, and **Sub-Agents** that drive each phase of the work. You steer; the skills do the heavy lifting and keep everything traceable.

**The AI Engineering Kit is the exclusive framework of the AI Engineering Accelerator** — Alex Sprogis' program that takes you from vibe-coder to AI engineer: shipping SaaS applications that are production-ready, secure, and good enough to sell.

---

## Quick Start

The scaffolder already ran `npm install` and a setup check. Open this project in the coding agent you installed it for — `.ai-eng-kit` → `agents` says which — and:

```
/verify-setup     Confirm the stack is wired and finish anything missing
/init             Define your product and a prioritized feature map
```

> **Codex writes these differently:** `$verify-setup`, `$init` — or pick them from the `/skills` menu.
> Every other agent uses `/`. Unsure? Run `/help` (or `$help`); it prints the syntax for this project.

`/init` runs a **discovery interview**, one question at a time (always with a recommended answer you confirm or correct), then writes your **PRD** (`docs/PRD.md`) and a prioritized **feature map** (`features/INDEX.md`). From there you build feature by feature.

```bash
npm run dev       # Start the dev server → http://localhost:3000
```

---

## The Workflow

Development runs in phases, each driven by a skill. Handoffs are always user-initiated — a skill suggests the next step, you run it when ready.

```
/init  →  /write-spec  →  /architecture  →  /tasks  →  /build  →  /qa  →  /deploy

         /refine PROJ-X   revisit any spec, anytime
         /e2e-tests        after /qa, lock in critical user journeys (optional)
         /help             where am I, what's next?
```

| Skill | Command | What it does |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| Setup Check | `/verify-setup` | Verifies the stack, auto-fixes what's safe, reports what needs you (e.g. Supabase keys) |
| Codebase Map | `/map` | For a project that already exists: writes what it is built with, how it is put together, its weak spots and a proposed feature map to `docs/codebase/` — evidence with file paths, read by `/init` |
| Reverse Spec | `/reverse-spec` | For a feature that already runs: reads the criteria off the code, you confirm them block by block, `/qa` then verifies — the regression net a grown project is missing |
| Refactor | `/refactor` | Splits one oversized, mixed-responsibility file into modules behind an unchanged facade — only where verified specs can prove behaviour survived |
| Project Initializer | `/init` | One-time setup: creates the PRD + feature map via the discovery interview |
| Feature Spec Writer | `/write-spec` | Writes a full spec for one feature (user stories, acceptance criteria, edge cases) |
| Spec Refiner | `/refine PROJ-X` | Reopens an existing spec to improve, extend, or challenge it |
| Solution Architect | `/architecture` | Designs a PM-friendly technical approach (decisions, no code) |
| Task Planner | `/tasks` | Breaks the design into an ordered, leveled, parallelizable task list |
| Builder | `/build` | Implements the feature end to end — schema, API, UI — working through `tasks.md` |
| QA Engineer | `/qa` | Tests against acceptance criteria, writes unit tests, re-runs the build's integration tests as regression, runs a security audit |
| E2E Test Engineer | `/e2e-tests` | Optional: Playwright tests for the few critical journeys that must never break |
| DevOps | `/deploy` | Deploys to your host (Vercel or Hostinger) with production-ready checks and database promotion |
| Help | `/help` | Context-aware guide: shows where you are and what to do next |
| Audit | `/audit` | Anytime drift check: confirms INDEX, specs, the AC→Task→Test chain, and code all still match |
| Security Check | `/security-check` | Non-destructive check of the live app: HTTPS, security headers, protected routes, no exposed secrets, Supabase RLS |

---

## Spec-Driven Core

Every feature lives in its own folder `features/PROJ-X-name/`:

| File | Created by | Role |
|------|-----------|------|
| `spec.md` | `/write-spec` | The **contract** — WHAT the feature does. Read-only during `/build`. |
| `design.md` | `/architecture` | The **technical design** — HOW it's built. |
| `tasks.md` | `/tasks` | The **ordered build plan**, with file-disjoint `[P]` tasks for parallel work. |
| `qa-report.md` | `/qa` | The **test report**, keyed by acceptance-criterion ID. |

**AC-IDs are the traceability backbone.** Every acceptance criterion in `spec.md` gets a stable ID (`AC-1`, `AC-2`, …; edge cases `EC-1`, …). Tasks reference the AC-IDs they fulfill, and `qa-report.md` reports per AC-ID — chaining **AC → Task → Test**.

**Native parallel build.** `/build` works `tasks.md` level by level. Within a level, file-disjoint `[P]` tasks fan out to parallel sub-agents (each isolated in its own git worktree); the main agent then integrates, verifies against the level's AC-IDs, and advances. No special tool or keyword — it runs in any Claude Code session.

## Test vs. Live Data (Supabase)

So you never develop against real user data, `/init` asks how you want to separate environments and records the choice in `docs/PRD.md` → Constraints. Every later skill reads it from there.

| Strategy | What it means | Cost |
|----------|---------------|------|
| **local** *(recommended, default)* | Supabase runs on your machine via **Docker** while you build; the schema is migrated to a hosted live project at `/deploy`. Needs Docker + the Supabase CLI. | Free |
| **two-projects** | A separate hosted **dev** project to test in and a **prod** project for real users. No Docker needed. | Free tier covers both |
| **single** | One hosted Supabase project — test and live are the same. Simplest, but no safety net. | Free |
| **branching** | One Pro project with an always-on **staging** branch, promoted to live with a Merge. | Supabase Pro (~$35/mo) |

`.env.local` always holds your **test** keys (local Docker instance / dev project / staging branch / the single project) — never live keys. Schema changes are captured as `supabase/migrations/*.sql` and promoted to production during `/deploy` (`supabase db push` for `local`). For `branching`, `/deploy` previews the schema diff in plain language and flags anything destructive before you Merge.

Building frontend-only (no backend)? `/init` records "localStorage only" and skips all of the above.

## Feature Tracking

All features are tracked in `features/INDEX.md`. Each row links to the feature **folder**:

| ID | Feature | Status | Spec |
|----|---------|--------|------|
| PROJ-1 | User Login | Deployed | [Folder](features/PROJ-1-user-login/) |
| PROJ-2 | Dashboard | In Progress | [Folder](features/PROJ-2-dashboard/) |

Status flow: **Roadmap → Planned → Architected → Tasked → In Progress → In Review → Approved → Deployed**. Every skill reads this file at start and updates it when done, preventing duplicate work.

## Tech Stack

| Category | Tool | Why |
|----------|------|-----|
| **Framework** | Next.js 16 (App Router) | React + Server Components |
| **Language** | TypeScript | Type safety |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS | Utility-first CSS |
| **UI Library** | shadcn/ui | Copy-paste, customizable components |
| **Backend** | Supabase (optional) | PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage |
| **Deployment** | Vercel or Hostinger | GitHub-connected auto-deploy |
| **Validation** | Zod + react-hook-form | Runtime validation |
| **Testing** | Vitest + Playwright | Unit/integration + E2E |

## How It Works Under the Hood

- **Skills** are structured workflows your agent discovers automatically. Most run inline (live interview / oversight); `/build` forks isolated sub-agents for parallel tasks and `/qa` fans out verification lanes. Where your agent has no sub-agents, the skills say so and work sequentially instead.
- **Rules** are the project-wide standards — workflow discipline, git conventions, working language, security. They are loaded in every session, so they apply to every skill without anyone loading them by hand.
- **The memory file** is auto-loaded every session with the tech stack, conventions, and pointers to the PRD and feature index.

**Where those live depends on your agent** — same content, each in the place that agent reads:

| agent | skills | rules |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills/` | `.claude/rules/` |
| Codex | `.codex/skills/` | inside the memory file |
| Cursor | `.cursor/skills/` | `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` |
| GitHub Copilot | `.github/skills/` | `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` |
| Antigravity | `.agents/skills/` | `.agents/rules/` |

**One file carries your project's context.** In a Claude-Code-only project that is `CLAUDE.md`; with any other agent it is `AGENTS.md`, and the remaining memory files are generated pointers to it. Edit the one with content — the pointers are overwritten on every update.

**One thing is not the same everywhere.** `.claude/settings.json` *blocks* reading `.env*` files and force-pushing. Only Claude Code enforces it. With the other agents the same rules are instructions your agent follows — real, but not a wall it cannot cross.

### Recommended (optional): live API docs

Memorized API knowledge goes stale. Connecting a live-docs MCP server like **[Context7](https://github.com/upstash/context7)** lets `/architecture` and `/build` pull the *current* API surface of libraries (Supabase, Stripe, Next.js, …) instead of relying on memory — fewer outdated-API bugs. It's entirely optional: every skill works without it and never blocks if it's absent. To enable it, add Context7 as an MCP server in your Claude Code settings.

- **State lives in files, not memory.** Every skill re-reads `features/INDEX.md` and the relevant feature folder at start — nothing is lost after a new session or context compaction.
- **Context is layered.** `CLAUDE.md` + rules (always) → `SKILL.md` (when invoked) → feature spec (on demand) → `docs/production/` (only when referenced).
- **Context is isolated.** Heavy work runs in forked sub-agents with their own context window, so noise from one task doesn't pollute another.
- **Always read, never guess.** A global rule enforces reading a file before modifying it and verifying paths/APIs by reading — preventing hallucinated code references.

## Scripts

```bash
npm run dev          # Development server (localhost:3000)
npm run build        # Production build
npm run start        # Production server
npm run lint         # ESLint
npm test             # Vitest: unit + integration tests
npm run test:e2e     # Playwright: E2E tests (added by /e2e-tests)
npm run test:all     # Both test suites
```

> Playwright browsers are **not** installed during setup. The first `/e2e-tests` run installs the browser binary (~300 MB) once — keeping everyday setup fast.

## Production Guides

Standalone guides in `docs/production/`, surfaced by `/deploy` when relevant:

| Guide | Setup | What it does |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| [Error Tracking](docs/production/error-tracking.md) | 5 min | Sentry integration for automatic error capture |
| [Security Headers](docs/production/security-headers.md) | 2 min | XSS, clickjacking, MIME-sniffing protection |
| [Performance](docs/production/performance.md) | 10 min | Lighthouse checks, image optimization, caching |
| [Database Optimization](docs/production/database-optimization.md) | 15 min | Indexing, N+1 prevention, query optimization |
| [Rate Limiting](docs/production/rate-limiting.md) | 10 min | Upstash Redis for API abuse prevention |

## Customize It

This is your project — adapt it freely:

1. **Your memory file** (`CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` — the one with content) — project-specific conventions and commands. Keep the managed block between the markers intact; it's refreshed on kit updates.
2. **docs/PRD.md** — product vision and roadmap
3. **Your agent's rules folder** — coding standards for your team
4. **Your agent's skills folder** — tweak the workflows themselves. Note that `npx create-ai-eng-app update` regenerates the kit's own skills; put your own in separate folders, they are kept.
5. **.claude/settings.json** — permissions (Claude Code)
